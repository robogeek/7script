# 7scriptrc - startup file for 7Script
#
# If the file <<<install>>>/lib/7scriptrc exists, then it is sourced
# while 7Script is starting.  This file, then, is an opportunity to set
# some site-wide values that are needed for all scripts on a particular
# host system.
#
# This file is not automatically installed.  If you wish to use it,
# either create your own or copy this one into place and modify it
# to suit.


# One might want to have various modules from the 7script directory
# automatically loaded.  If so, uncomment the following
#
#package require 7oo
#package require 7sql
#package require 7util

# If you are using the 7portal package, uncomment the following.
#
#package require 7tree

# If you have other directories where packages are installed, then
# you have a little bit of setup to do.  For example, this is required
# in properly setting up the 7portal package.
#
# One makes a package, which subclasses the 7portal modules, and installs
# this package in the normal fashion of a TCL package.
#
# If the package is not installed in the standard tcl_pkgPath locations
# then you uncomment the following, and specify the directory
#
#lappend tcl_pkgPath directory
#
# Next, reference the package using the appropriate "package require" command
#
#package require packageName
